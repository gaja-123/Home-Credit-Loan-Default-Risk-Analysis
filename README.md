# Home-Credit-Loan-Default-Risk-Analysis

Analytical case study on Home Credit loan default risk: identifies key risk drivers using Chi-square tests and logistic regression. Includes actionable recommendations based on 307,511 loan applications.



# Home Credit Loan Default Risk Analysis: Case Study Workflow and Recommendations

## Overview

This case study analyzes loan default risk for Home Credit, which serves financially underserved populations, using a dataset of 307,511 loan applications. The analysis leverages Chi-square tests and logistic regression to evaluate seven risk drivers: income type, regional rating, external credit scores, age cohorts, age segments, credit inquiries, and application weekdays. The objective is to provide evidence-based recommendations to reduce defaults by 15‚Äì30% while enhancing inclusion for low-risk groups.



Key objectives:

- Identify and rank impact of risk drivers on default odds.

- Propose targeted policy changes based on statistical findings.

- Estimate potential default reduction through tiered policies.

## Project Structure

- Data/: Contains the dataset (not included here; derived from internal Home Credit records).

- Docs/: Includes the full case study report PDF ("case study report.pdf").

- Visuals/: Logistic regression results (Figures A1-A8 in the appendix).



## Analytical Workflow

The project is divided into four phases:

### Phase 1: Data Loading & Analysis

- Analyzed 307,511 loan applications.

- Evaluated seven risk drivers using Chi-square tests and logistic regression.

- Ranked factors by impact on default odds.

### Phase 2: Key Findings - Statistical Tests

- Income Type: Highest impact (up to +551% odds), with unstable income sources (e.g., Unemployed +551%, Maternity Leave +61%) driving extreme risk.

- Regional Rating: High impact (up to +146% odds), with poorer regions (Region 3 +146%) showing higher defaults.

- External Credit Scores: High impact (‚Äì73.5% odds), with scores >0.5 reducing default risk significantly.

- Age Cohorts (12 Bands): High impact (‚Äì61.7% odds), risk declines steadily with age.

- Broad Age Segments: Medium impact (‚Äì53.2% odds), seniors (>50) are safest.

- Credit Inquiries: Low impact (+3.7% odds), multiple inquiries slightly raise risk.

- Application Weekday: Lowest impact (¬±5.2% odds), minimal variation with Tuesday slightly riskier.

### Phase 3: Conclusion & Recommendations

- Conclusion: Top levers for risk reduction are income type, regional rating, external scores, and age.

- Evidence-Based Recommendations:

  - Income Type: Deny/cap loans for Unemployed & Maternity Leave; offer 1‚Äì2% rate discounts to Pensioners/State Servants; tighten income verification for Working/Commercial Associates.

  - Regional Rating: Raise rates or collateral in Region 3 by ~25%; fast-track approvals in Region 1; cap Region 3 loan amounts at 70% of standard.

  - External Credit Scores: Auto-approve >0.5 with minimal checks; require collateral or reject ‚â§0.5; expand bureau partnerships.

  - Age Cohorts: Require guarantors for youngest cohorts (0‚Äì3); relax terms for oldest (9‚Äì11); build age-based risk models.

  - Broad Age Segments: Extra scrutiny & financial literacy for <30; prioritize >50 in portfolio mix; limit <30 exposure to ~25%.

  - Credit Inquiries: Flag >2 for manual review; cap loan size; offer credit counseling.

  - Application Weekday: Increase Tuesday checks; promote low-risk days; monitor but deprioritize for major policy changes.

- Expected Impact: Tiered policies could cut defaults by 15‚Äì30% while improving inclusion for low-risk groups.

### Phase 4: Limitations & Future Work

- Limitations:

  - Data scope limited to provided dataset; may not capture macroeconomic shocks or post-loan behavioral changes.

  - Missing variables (e.g., debt-to-income ratio, employment tenure).

  - Model simplification assumes linear log-odds relationships.

  - Multicollinearity and lack of time-series modeling.

- Future Work:

  - Incorporate additional borrower metrics (e.g., payment history, debt ratios).

  - Test advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM, survival analysis).

  - Develop multi-factor risk tiers and behavioral tracking.

  - Conduct A/B testing and enhance explainability with SHAP/partial dependence plots.
